# BUAD5042Knapsack
Programs and Data for the Knapsack Assignment

This repository contains the files necessary for the Knapsack Algorithm Assignment for the BUAD 5042, Heuristic Algorithms, 
course at the College of William & Mary.

The repository contents include these files:
    * knapsack.dmp
        - MySQL dump file to be imported into MySQL.  It contains knpsack problem data.
    * scoreKnapsackDev.py
        - Python program that contains a "stub" area to put a load_knapsack() function which chooses which items are
          to be included in a knapsack.
        - This program also applies the algorithm specified in load_knapsack() to all the test problems in the
          knapsack database through existing functions
        - Set silent_mode = False
        - Leave the problems list unchanged
        
The database contains original knapsack problems as well as problems from this web site:
